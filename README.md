# The LoRa Library for TM4C123 & Raspberry Pi
Collection of functions for using the RFM69HCW with both Raspberry Pi &amp; TM4C123 Launchpad

## Getting Started

The RFM69HCW is a powerfull and (somewhat) easy to use LoRa Transciver. This Library does not go into all usecases, but rather a simple guide to get you up and running for your next project!

### Prerequisites

Raspberry Pi 3 Requirements:
```
Python 3.x
Raspbian
SPI Interface 0 (can be changed by modifying software)
```
TM4C123 Requirements:
```
uVision 5
Tivaware Libraries
```
Hardware Requirements:
```
RFM69HCW - Lora Tranciver
TM4C123 - Embedded Platform
Raspberry Pi 3B+ - Embedded Linux Platform
```

### Pin Mapping

Some Soldering required!

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
